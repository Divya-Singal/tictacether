# tictacether
A basic tic tac toe, bet and win ether (that is, if you win the game) ! 
To get this up and running in your system, kindly follow the steps.

Not that it might matter for the experienced readers, but my development environment is as follows:<br>
Operating System : Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, Bionic Beaver

Technology breakout:

Front End : Angular JS , Skeleton borrowed from angular-seed. <br>
Styling  : Bootstrap 3.3.7 CDN  <br>
Back End : Node Js ( node -v : 8)  <br>
To interact with Ethereum framework, i have used web3.js  <br>
Remix.ide to generate ABI, Bytecode out of the solidity contract.  <br>
Code Versioning : Git <3  <br>


## Getting the Repo
Step 1: git clone https://github.com/Divya-Singal/tictacether.git

## Installing prerequisites/ Dependencies
I have added node_modules in the initial github repo, they will be taken off in future , so for safe side :- <br>
step 2: cd angular-seed <br>
step 3: npm install <br>

step 4: cd../node <br>
step 5: npm install <br>

## Get the system up and running

Step 6 : cd node <br>
step 7 : node index  (in the terminal, get the node server running, which will listen to port : 4000)<br>

(in a new terminal window, so that we dont close off our node server)
Step 8 : cd angular-seed<br>
Step 9 : npm start ( after running the command in the terminal, browse to the app at localhost:8000/index.html. )<br>
